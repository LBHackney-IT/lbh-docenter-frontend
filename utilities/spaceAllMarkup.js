# Into the void, from the void

For those who have seen the __Earth from space__, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most
certainly changes your perspective. The things that we *share* in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.

## The scale

It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb
blotted out the planet Earth. I didn’t feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.

### Time, the great compounder

Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the _next year_ and yet far too little for the **next 10**.

One can get a perspective by reading Isaac Asimov Foundation series:

1. Prelude to Foundation (1988)
2. Forward the Foundation (1993)
3. Foundation (1951)
   4. Foundation and Empire (1952)
   5. Second Foundation (1953)
   6. Foundation's Edge (1982)
   7. Foundation and Earth (1986)

We choose to \`go to the moon\` in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard,
because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that
we are willing to accept, one we are ~~unwilling to postpone~~, and one which we intend to win.

### Monumental Undertaking

There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the
generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.

A wise blockquote was once said:

> As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man
> must explore . . . and this is exploration at its greatest.

## A Globe

Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the
qualities of a globe, _a round earth in which all the directions **eventually** meet_, in which there is no center because every
point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman’s earth, if free men make it, will be
truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.

***To be the first to enter the cosmos***, to engage, single-handed, in an unprecedented duel with nature—could one dream of
anything more?

There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy
the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.

We are all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically.
